## Test Status: Passed
See testRunInfo.json, diffs.tar, and error-logs.txt in run.tar

## Factors Tested
### C: File edit patterns
Edit pattern per file
1. Set run.tarâ€™s size to 10 MB
2. Attempt to run to establish baseline
3. Delete file contents
4. Run with no edits
5. Run with a file edited to become >3 MB
6. Run with multiple edits
7. Run with no edits
8. Run with two separate files edited to become >5 MB
9. Delete comments from two files
10. Run with no edits
Outcome: Correct diffs.tar file counts and testRunInfo.json in run.tar; error-logs.txt should be empty

### D: File churn type
File churn type
1. Add a large (between 1 and 3 MB) file
  - LargeClass1.java
2. Large (between 1 and 3 MB) new file added and small file
  - LargeClass2.java
3. Different file deleted and small file edited
4. Large files and new small file deleted
Outcome: Correct diffs.tar file counts and testRunInfo.json in run.tar; error-logs.txt should be empty

NOTE: These tests are overlapped by rerunning each step of D for the runs in Steps 4-10 of C, totaling 24, with 6 empty additional classes (SampleClass1-6) for deletion
