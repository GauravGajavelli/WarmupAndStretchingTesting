## Performance Test: Realistic Baseline

### Purpose
- This test is aimed at gauging the performance of the logger by recording the growth of the output of the output file and the speed at which tests execute

### Steps
- Going through the assignment and running tests as usual, but running all tests every other test run to stress test log size

### Requirements
- The size of the logs (run.tar) should not exceed 10 MB
- The additional run time due to logging is below 500 ms

### Test Status: Passed
